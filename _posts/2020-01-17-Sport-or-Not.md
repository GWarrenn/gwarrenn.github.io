About The Survey
--------------

Following up in the rich tradition of creating surveys that throw a molotov cocktail into social situations, I opened another question to the world: Are these things sports?  

Respondents were presented with a list of 19 activities that could or not be considered a sport depending on who you ask. The activities ranged from Skiing to Frisbee Golf to Scrabble.

Overall Sports
--------------

On average, the field is adamant that Rowing/Crew (which is ) is most defintely a sport -- even though it's basically just going for a canoe ride and yet Chess, a sport that requires skill and training and [tons of physical endurance](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/27593253/why-grandmasters-magnus-carlsen-fabiano-caruana-lose-weight-playing-chess) IS NOT SPORT WELL OKAY THEN FINE -- with nearly three quarters stating they feel strongly it's a sport. NASCAR is really the only sport than comes close to the only activity that is net even on the Sport/Not Sport divide, with 55% to 42%. 

Correlations
--------------

The following chart shows the correlation, or similarity, between each of the activities tested - a score of 1 indicates that everyone picked exactly the same thing, while a score of -1 indicates the opposite. Some strong positive relationships can be found between the activities that were definitely selected as sports, such as Skiing, Rowing/Crew, and Cycling. However, the strongest negative relationships are found between Snowboarding and Scrabble.

Ratings by Demographics
--------------

Overall, women are more skeptical that the acitvities tested are actually sports. Views tend to align on the more commonly accepted sports, such as Cycling and Skiing. However things tend to break down among the more contentious activies, specifically NASCAR. Only 29% of women view NASCAR as a sport, compared to 65% of men. Bowling, Frisbee Golf, Cornhole, and eSports are also viewed differently by gender.

Before we look at other demographics tested, we should also talk about views towards sports in general by gender. The survey also asked sports watching behaviors and attitudes towards sports, which turned out to be influenced by gender. 

Views towards P.E./Gym class by gender are nearly a mirror image. Just under half of women who took the survey were strongly unfavorable towards P.E./Gym class when they were in school, compared to only 5.6% of men.
