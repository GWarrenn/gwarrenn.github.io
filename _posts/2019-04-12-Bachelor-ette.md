Since 2011, my friend Ben Winston, one of the [country's brightest up-and-coming political pollsters](https://www.strategies360.com/2019/04/09/leading-political-researcher-joins-s360/), has invited friends and just about anyone he can find to join his Bachelor/ette Pool. Competitors are tasked with predicting the final ranking order of the season based only on a headshot and a very small set of biographical information for each contestant. After each episode of the show airs, a score and subsequent ranking are determined for each competitor based on how closely their predicted ranking correlates with the actual ranking, essentially assigning an R^2 for everyone in the pool (I managed to score a perfect 0.00 in Colton's season, which sums up my feelings about Colton).      

Inspired by [this visualization](http://thestoryoftheseason.com/), I created this visualization to track the ups and downs in standings as the drama unfolds.
