My name is August Warren, though most people call me Gus.

I'm a researcher/data scientist interested in the intersection of data and politics/policy/government/sociology/whisky. I have a specific interest in assessing inequalities in housing and public safety. This website is a space for my personal research and settling arguments I'm having with friends about [fruit](https://gwarrenn.github.io/Fruit-Ranking/) or [Gatorade flavors](https://gwarrenn.github.io/Definitive-Gatorade-Ranking/). 

While originally from Ann Arbor, Michigan, I've been living in Washington, DC since 2013 when I started working in political polling and survey research. Since then, I've worked in the data and research department of the DC State Superintendent of Education, where I was fortunate enough to be able to contribute to the [2017-18](https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/2017-18%20School%20Year%20Attendance%20Report.pdf) & [2018-19](https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/2018-19%20School%20Year%20Attendance%20Report.pdf) Attendance reports. This work focused on the socioeconomic barriers that students in the District face in attending school - such as distance, proximal crime, and housing instability - as well as other various analyses that never saw the light of day. As of today, I am currently working in the data science department of a cybersecurity firm where I am tasked with modelling and identifying anomoulous/malicious events in real-time streaming data.  

Any and all thoughts/opinions on this page are purely my own (or hastily copied from stackoverflow).
